To run with the h2 db use command "gradle bootRun -Dspring.profiles.active=h2"

For postgres this is similar but iwth profile "postgres", however I have not yet been 
able to get this working as I am a bit rusty on postgres and I am having trouble 
connecting the app to the local postgres db.  Try it - it might work for you.
